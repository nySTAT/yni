T-cell Receptor (TCR) repertoire sequencing is a relatively new technology that enables monitoring of T-cells, a subset of immune cells that play a central role in modulating immune response. These immunologic relationships are complex and are governed by various distributional aspects of an individual patient's tumor profile. We propose Bayesian QUANTIle regression for hierarchical COvariates (QUANTICO) that allows simultaneous modeling of hierarchical relationships between multi-level covariates, conducts explicit variable selection, estimates quantile and patient-specific coefficient effects, to induce individualized inference. We show QUANTICO outperforms existing approaches in multiple simulation scenarios. We demonstrate the utility of QUANTICO to investigate the effect of TCR variables on immune response in a cohort of lung cancer patients. At population level, our analyses reveal the mechanistic role of T-cell proportion on the immune cell abundance, with tumor mutation burden as an important factor modulating this relationship. At a patient level, we find several outlier patients based on their quantile-specific coefficient functions, who have higher mutational rates and different smoking history.","tags":["Quantile Regression","Variable Selection","Cancer","Data Integration","Heterogeneity","Thresholding Prior","Precision Medicine","Splines","Biomarkers"],"title":"Bayesian Hierarchical Quantile Regression with Application to Characterizing the Immune Architecture of Lung Cancer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hee Cheol Chung","Yang Ni","Irina Gaynanova"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1660176000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660176000,"objectID":"684ee6a0e16ffe2738c93f8dc22c2658","permalink":"https://nystat.github.io/yni/publication/j_clda/","publishdate":"2022-08-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/yni/publication/j_clda/","section":"publication","summary":"Discriminant analysis for zero-inflated data.","tags":["Copula","Microbiome Data","Zero-Inflated Data","Count Data","Classification","Supervised Learning","Variable Selection"],"title":"Sparse Semiparametric Discriminant Analysis for High-Dimensional Zero-Inflated Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fangting Zhou","Kejun He","James J.

By understanding the mechanism(s) by which CAF contributes to tumor growth, new therapeutic targets for the management of this disease may be identified. These studies determined whether unique sub‐populations of human prostate CAF can be identified and functionally characterized. Single‐cell RNA‐seq of primary human prostate CAF followed by unsupervised clustering was utilized to generate cell clusters based on differentially expressed (DE) gene profiles. Potential communication between CAF and immune cells was analyzed using in vivo tissue recombination by combining CAF or normal prostate fibroblasts (NPF) with non‐tumorigenic, initiated prostate epithelial BPH‐1 cells. Resultant grafts were assessed for inflammatory cell recruitment. Clustering of 3321 CAF allows for visualization of six subpopulations, demonstrating heterogeneity within CAF. Sub‐renal capsule recombination assays show that the presence of CAF significantly increases myeloid cell recruitment to resultant tumors. This is supported by significantly increased expression of chemotactic chemokines CCL2 and CXCL12 in large clusters compared to other subpopulations. Bayesian analysis topologies also support differential communication signals between chemokine‐related genes of individual clusters. Migration of THP‐1 monocyte cells in vitro is stimulated in the presence of CAF conditioned medium (CM) compared with NPF CM. Further in vitro analyses suggest that CAF‐derived chemokine CCL2 may be responsible for CAF‐stimulated migration of THP‐1 cells, since neutralization of this chemokine abrogates migration capacity. CAF clustering based on DE gene expression supports the concept that clusters have unique functions within the TME, including a role in immune/ inflammatory cell recruitment. These data suggest that CCL2 produced by CAF may be involved in the recruitment of inflammatory cells, but may also directly regulate the growth of the tumor. Further studies aimed at characterizing the subpopulation(s) of CAF which promote immune cell recruitment to the TME and/or stimulate prostate cancer growth and progression will be pursued.","tags":["Single-Cell RNA-Seq","Graphical Model","Cancer","Multi-Omics"],"title":"Heterogeneity of Human Prostate Carcinoma-Associated Fibroblasts Implicates a Role for Subpopulations in Myeloid Cell Recruitment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yang Ni","Peter Müller","Maurice Diesendruck","Sinead Williamson","Yitan Zhu","Yuan Ji"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"7464122ea98338443ee505013e03862e","permalink":"https://nystat.github.io/yni/publication/j_sign/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/yni/publication/j_sign/","section":"publication","summary":"A scalable Monte Carlo algorithm for inference under a large class of nonparametric Bayesian models for clustering and classification.","tags":["EHR","Big Data","Bayesian Nonparametrics","Consensus Monte Carlo","Parallel Computing","Clustering","Classification","GAN","Deep Learning"],"title":"Scalable Bayesian Nonparametric Clustering and Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yang Ni","Francesco Stingo","Min Jin Ha","Rehan Akbani","Veerabhadran Baladandayuthapani"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1563148800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563148800,"objectID":"7efd1484fd12879f689c74d4b939e199","permalink":"https://nystat.github.io/yni/publication/j_behavior/","publishdate":"2019-07-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/yni/publication/j_behavior/","section":"publication","summary":"A Bayesian hierarchical varying-sparsity regression (BEHAVIOR) model that selects clinically relevant disease markers by integrating proteogenomic and clinical data.","tags":["Variable Selection","Biomarkers","Precision Medicine","Splines","Thresholding Prior","Multi-omics","Heterogeneity","Cancer","Data Integration"],"title":"Bayesian Hierarchical Varying-sparsity Model with Application to Cancer Proteogenomics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tian Ge","Chia-Yen Chen","Yang Ni","Yen-Chen Anne Feng","Jordan W.

Here, we describe Bayesian approaches for both undirected and directed networks; we discuss novel approaches that are computationally efficient, do not rely on linearity assumptions, and perform comparatively better than state-of-the-art methods.
