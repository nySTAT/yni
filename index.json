Existing literature almost exclusively focuses on the Chinese restaurant franchise (CRF) analogy of the marginal distribution of the parameters, which can mix poorly and has a quadratic complexity with the sample size. A recently developed slice sampler allows for efficient blocked updates of the parameters, but is shown to be statistically unstable in our article. We develop a blocked Gibbs sampler that employs a truncated approximation of the underlying random measures to sample from the posterior distribution of HDP, which produces statistically stable results, is highly scalable with respect to sample size, and is shown to have good mixing. The heart of the construction is to endow the shared concentration parameter with an appropriately chosen gamma prior that allows us to break the dependence of the shared mixing proportions and permits independent updates of certain log-concave random variables in a block. En route, we develop an efficient rejection sampler for these random variables leveraging piece-wise tangent-line approximations. Supplementary materials, which include substantive additional details and code, are available online.","tags":["Bayesian Nonparametrics","Dirichlet Process","Clustering"],"title":"Blocked Gibbs Sampler for Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arhit Chakrabarti","Yang Ni","Bani K.

Spatial clustering of the cells provides valuable insights into the understanding of the functional organization of the tissue. However, most such clustering methods involve some dimension reduction that leads to a loss of the inherent dependency structure among genes at any spatial location in the tissue. This destroys valuable insights of gene co-expression patterns apart from possibly impacting spatial clustering performance. In spatial transcriptomics, the matrix-variate gene expression data, along with spatial coordinates of the single cells, provides information on both gene expression dependencies and cell spatial dependencies through its row and column covariances. In this work, we propose a joint Bayesian approach to simultaneously estimate these gene and spatial cell correlations. These estimates provide data summaries for downstream analyses. We illustrate our method with simulations and analysis of several real spatial transcriptomic datasets. Our work elucidates gene co-expression networks as well as clear spatial clustering patterns of the cells. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that downstream spatial-differential analysis may aid in the discovery of unknown cell types from known marker genes.","tags":["Heterogeneity","Multi-Omics","Data Integration","Clustering","Single-Cell RNA-Seq","Spatial Transcriptomics","Gaussian Process","Gene Regulatory Network"],"title":"Joint Bayesian Estimation of Cell Dependence and Gene Associations in Spatially Resolved Transcriptomic Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Canaan M.

The observed changes, however, have not been linked to host function and therefore it remains unclear how specifc changes in the microbiome alter cellular and molecular pathways within the GI tract. Further, non-invasive techniques to examine the host gene expression profle of the GI mucosa have been described in horses but not evaluated in response to interventions. Therefore, the objectives of our study were to profile gene expression and metabolomic changes in an equine model of non-steroidal anti-infammatory drug (NSAID)-induced intestinal infammation and apply computational data integration methods to examine host-microbiota interactions. Twenty horses were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups, control (placebo paste) or NSAID (phenylbutazone 4.4 mg/kg orally once daily for 9 days). Fecal samples were collected on days 0 and 10 and analyzed with respect to microbiota (16S rDNA gene sequencing), metabolomic (untargeted metabolites), and host exfoliated cell transcriptomic (exfoliome) changes. Data were analyzed and integrated using a variety of computational techniques, and underlying regulatory mechanisms were inferred from features that were commonly identifed by all computational approaches. Phenylbutazone induced alterations in the microbiota, metabolome, and host transcriptome. Data integration identifed correlation of specifc bacterial genera with expression of several genes and metabolites that were linked to oxidative stress. Concomitant microbiota and metabolite changes resulted in the initiation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response within the intestinal mucosa. Results of integrative analysis identifed an important role for oxidative stress, and subsequent cell signaling responses, in a large animal model of GI infammation. The computational approaches for combining noninvasive platforms for unbiased assessment of host GI responses (e.g., exfoliomics) with metabolomic and microbiota changes have broad application for the feld of gastroenterology.","tags":["Microbiome","Metabolome","Exfoliome","Classificiation","Multi-Omics","Data Integration"],"title":"Integrated Analysis of Gut Metabolome, Microbiome, and Exfoliome Data in an Equine Model of Intestinal Injury","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wei Jin","Yang Ni","Amanda B.

T-cell Receptor (TCR) repertoire sequencing is a relatively new technology that enables monitoring of T-cells, a subset of immune cells that play a central role in modulating immune response. These immunologic relationships are complex and are governed by various distributional aspects of an individual patient's tumor profile. We propose Bayesian QUANTIle regression for hierarchical COvariates (QUANTICO) that allows simultaneous modeling of hierarchical relationships between multi-level covariates, conducts explicit variable selection, estimates quantile and patient-specific coefficient effects, to induce individualized inference. We show QUANTICO outperforms existing approaches in multiple simulation scenarios. We demonstrate the utility of QUANTICO to investigate the effect of TCR variables on immune response in a cohort of lung cancer patients. At population level, our analyses reveal the mechanistic role of T-cell proportion on the immune cell abundance, with tumor mutation burden as an important factor modulating this relationship. At a patient level, we find several outlier patients based on their quantile-specific coefficient functions, who have higher mutational rates and different smoking history.","tags":["Quantile Regression","Variable Selection","Cancer","Data Integration","Heterogeneity","Thresholding Prior","Precision Medicine","Splines","Biomarkers"],"title":"Bayesian Hierarchical Quantile Regression with Application to Characterizing the Immune Architecture of Lung Cancer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hee Cheol Chung","Yang Ni","Irina Gaynanova"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1660176000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660176000,"objectID":"684ee6a0e16ffe2738c93f8dc22c2658","permalink":"https://nystat.github.io/yni/publication/j_clda/","publishdate":"2022-08-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/yni/publication/j_clda/","section":"publication","summary":"Discriminant analysis for zero-inflated data.","tags":["Copula","Microbiome Data","Zero-Inflated Data","Count Data","Classification","Supervised Learning","Variable Selection"],"title":"Sparse Semiparametric Discriminant Analysis for High-Dimensional Zero-Inflated Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fangting Zhou","Kejun He","James J.

By understanding the mechanism(s) by which CAF contributes to tumor growth, new therapeutic targets for the management of this disease may be identified. These studies determined whether unique sub‐populations of human prostate CAF can be identified and functionally characterized. Single‐cell RNA‐seq of primary human prostate CAF followed by unsupervised clustering was utilized to generate cell clusters based on differentially expressed (DE) gene profiles. Potential communication between CAF and immune cells was analyzed using in vivo tissue recombination by combining CAF or normal prostate fibroblasts (NPF) with non‐tumorigenic, initiated prostate epithelial BPH‐1 cells. Resultant grafts were assessed for inflammatory cell recruitment. Clustering of 3321 CAF allows for visualization of six subpopulations, demonstrating heterogeneity within CAF. Sub‐renal capsule recombination assays show that the presence of CAF significantly increases myeloid cell recruitment to resultant tumors. This is supported by significantly increased expression of chemotactic chemokines CCL2 and CXCL12 in large clusters compared to other subpopulations. Bayesian analysis topologies also support differential communication signals between chemokine‐related genes of individual clusters. Migration of THP‐1 monocyte cells in vitro is stimulated in the presence of CAF conditioned medium (CM) compared with NPF CM. Further in vitro analyses suggest that CAF‐derived chemokine CCL2 may be responsible for CAF‐stimulated migration of THP‐1 cells, since neutralization of this chemokine abrogates migration capacity. CAF clustering based on DE gene expression supports the concept that clusters have unique functions within the TME, including a role in immune/ inflammatory cell recruitment. These data suggest that CCL2 produced by CAF may be involved in the recruitment of inflammatory cells, but may also directly regulate the growth of the tumor. Further studies aimed at characterizing the subpopulation(s) of CAF which promote immune cell recruitment to the TME and/or stimulate prostate cancer growth and progression will be pursued.","tags":["Single-Cell RNA-Seq","Graphical Model","Cancer","Multi-Omics"],"title":"Heterogeneity of Human Prostate Carcinoma-Associated Fibroblasts Implicates a Role for Subpopulations in Myeloid Cell Recruitment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yang Ni","Peter Müller","Maurice Diesendruck","Sinead Williamson","Yitan Zhu","Yuan Ji"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"7464122ea98338443ee505013e03862e","permalink":"https://nystat.github.io/yni/publication/j_sign/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/yni/publication/j_sign/","section":"publication","summary":"A scalable Monte Carlo algorithm for inference under a large class of nonparametric Bayesian models for clustering and classification.","tags":["EHR","Big Data","Bayesian Nonparametrics","Consensus Monte Carlo","Parallel Computing","Clustering","Classification","GAN","Deep Learning"],"title":"Scalable Bayesian Nonparametric Clustering and Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yang Ni","Francesco Stingo","Min Jin Ha","Rehan Akbani","Veerabhadran Baladandayuthapani"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1563148800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563148800,"objectID":"7efd1484fd12879f689c74d4b939e199","permalink":"https://nystat.github.io/yni/publication/j_behavior/","publishdate":"2019-07-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/yni/publication/j_behavior/","section":"publication","summary":"A Bayesian hierarchical varying-sparsity regression (BEHAVIOR) model that selects clinically relevant disease markers by integrating proteogenomic and clinical data.","tags":["Variable Selection","Biomarkers","Precision Medicine","Splines","Thresholding Prior","Multi-omics","Heterogeneity","Cancer","Data Integration"],"title":"Bayesian Hierarchical Varying-sparsity Model with Application to Cancer Proteogenomics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tian Ge","Chia-Yen Chen","Yang Ni","Yen-Chen Anne Feng","Jordan W.
